# - Find NetCDF
# Find the native NetCDF includes and library

#  NETCDF_CXX         - require the C++ interface and link the C++ library

# NETCDF_LIBRARIES if the corresponding option above is set.
#
#  NETCDF_LIBRARIES_C    - Just the C interface
#  NETCDF_LIBRARIES_CXX  - C++ interface, if available
#  NETCDF_LIBRARIES_F77  - Fortran 77 interface, if available
#  NETCDF_LIBRARIES_F90  - Fortran 90 interface, if available
